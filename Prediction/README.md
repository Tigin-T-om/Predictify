# Machine Learning Predictions Web Application

A Flask-based web application that provides various machine learning prediction services including house prices, employee salaries, diabetes risk assessment, fruit classification, and temperature predictions.

## Features

- **House Price Prediction**: Predicts house prices based on square footage
- **Salary Prediction**: Estimates employee salaries based on experience, education, and certifications
- **Diabetes Risk Assessment**: Evaluates diabetes risk based on health metrics
- **Fruit Classification**: Classifies fruits based on physical characteristics
- **Temperature Prediction**: Forecasts temperature based on weather conditions
